    <h1 id="red">How it all begined</h1>
    <p id="description">In 1944, Paul Van Doren dropped out of intermediate school in 8th grade at age fourteen when he realized he did not like school.
       He had a strong passion for horses and found his way to the race track where he earned the nickname "Dutch the Clutch", 
       and for one dollar he would give the odds of the race. Paul's mother, Rena, did not enjoy the idea of Paul being without a job and 
       not in school, so she insisted he gets a job at Randy's, a shoe manufacturer. His job entailed sweeping the floors and making shoes. 
       Paul eventually became the executive vice president of the company at just 34 years old. Randy's became one of the biggest shoe 
       manufacturers in the US. From Van Doren's quick success in Massachusetts, he was ordered to turn around a failing Randy's factory 
       in Garden Grove, California, that was losing close to a million dollars each month. Paul and his brother Jim moved their families 
       and settled in Anaheim to help the factory. After just eight months of being in Garden Grove, the factory was functioning better 
       than the one in Massachusetts. Three months after trying to save the Garden Grove factory, Paul decided he wanted to start his own 
       shoe brand.</p>
